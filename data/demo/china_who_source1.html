<mark class="entity E" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva" >GENEVA</mark> (<mark class="entity E" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters" >Reuters</mark>) - <mark class="entity E" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China" >China</mark> has agreed that <mark class="entity E" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization" >the World Health Organization</mark> will send international experts there <mark class="entity D" >as soon as possible</mark> to increase understanding of a new coronavirus and guide the global response to the outbreak, the <mark class="entity E" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" >U.N.</mark> agency said on <mark class="entity D" >Tuesday</mark>.<br />
In a statement after a <mark class="entity D" >two-day</mark> visit by <mark class="entity E" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization" >WHO</mark> director-general <mark class="entity E" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tedros_Adhanom" >Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus</mark>, who met <mark class="entity E" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China" >Chinese</mark> <mark class="entity E" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping" >President Xi Jinping</mark> as well as the health and foreign ministers, it said that a better understanding of the virus’ ability to spread from person to person was urgently needed to advise other countries.<br />
“<mark class="entity B" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times" >The</mark> discussions focused on continued collaboration on containment measures in <mark class="entity E" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan" >Wuhan</mark>, public health measures in other cities and provinces, conducting further studies on the severity and transmissibility of the virus, continuing to share data, and for <mark class="entity E" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China" >China</mark> to share biological material with <mark class="entity E" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization" >WHO</mark>,” the <mark class="entity C" >WHO</mark> said.<br />
This would contribute to developing vaccines and treatments.<br />
“<mark class="entity B" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times" >The</mark> <mark class="entity D" >two</mark> sides agreed that <mark class="entity E" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization" >WHO</mark> will send international experts to visit <mark class="entity E" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China" >China</mark> <mark class="entity D" >as soon as possible</mark> to work with <mark class="entity E" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China" >Chinese</mark> counterparts on increasing understanding of the outbreak to guide global response efforts,” the WHO added, without giving a time frame.<br />
<mark class="entity E" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping" >Xi</mark> said earlier on <mark class="entity D" >Tuesday</mark> that <mark class="entity E" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China" >China</mark> was sure of defeating the “devil” coronavirus that has killed <mark class="entity D" >106</mark> people, spread across the world and rattled financial markets.<br />
<mark class="entity E" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tedros_Adhanom" >Tedros</mark> can reconvene the <mark class="entity C" >WHO Emergency Committee</mark> on very short notice as needed, to consider whether the outbreak constitutes an international emergency, the <mark class="entity C" >WHO</mark> said in the statement, which made no reference to evacuations of foreigners that both sides say were discussed in the <mark class="entity E" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China" >Beijing</mark> talks.<br />
The WHO’s independent panel met twice last week, but declined to declare a global emergency. ___MICROSOFT___

<mark class="entity E">GENEVA</mark> (<mark class="entity E">Reuters</mark>) - <mark class="entity E">China</mark> has agreed that <mark class="entity E">the World Health Organization</mark> will send international experts there <mark class="entity D">as soon as possible</mark> to increase understanding of a new coronavirus and guide the global response to the outbreak, the <mark class="entity E">U.N.</mark> agency said on <mark class="entity D">Tuesday</mark>.<br />
In a statement after a <mark class="entity D">two-day</mark> visit by <mark class="entity E">WHO</mark> director-general <mark class="entity E">Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus</mark>, who met <mark class="entity E">Chinese</mark> <mark class="entity E">President Xi Jinping</mark> as well as the health and foreign ministers, it said that a better understanding of the virus’ ability to spread from person to person was urgently needed to advise other countries.<br />
“<mark class="entity E">The</mark> discussions focused on continued collaboration on containment measures in <mark class="entity E">Wuhan</mark>, public health measures in other cities and provinces, conducting further studies on the severity and transmissibility of the virus, continuing to share data, and for <mark class="entity E">China</mark> to share biological material with <mark class="entity E">WHO</mark>,” the <mark class="entity C">WHO</mark> said.<br />
This would contribute to developing vaccines and treatments.<br />
“<mark class="entity E">The</mark> <mark class="entity D">two</mark> sides agreed that <mark class="entity E">WHO</mark> will send international experts to visit <mark class="entity E">China</mark> <mark class="entity D">as soon as possible</mark> to work with <mark class="entity E">Chinese</mark> counterparts on increasing understanding of the outbreak to guide global response efforts,” the WHO added, without giving a time frame.<br />
<mark class="entity E">Xi</mark> said earlier on <mark class="entity D">Tuesday</mark> that <mark class="entity E">China</mark> was sure of defeating the “devil” coronavirus that has killed <mark class="entity D">106</mark> people, spread across the world and rattled financial markets.<br />
<mark class="entity E">Tedros</mark> can reconvene the <mark class="entity C">WHO Emergency <mark class="entity E">Committee</mark></mark> on very short notice as needed, to consider whether the outbreak constitutes an international emergency, the <mark class="entity C">WHO</mark> said in the statement, which made no reference to evacuations of foreigners that both sides say were discussed in the <mark class="entity E">Beijing</mark> talks.<br />
The WHO’s independent panel met twice last week, but declined to declare a global emergency. ___MICROSOFT___
